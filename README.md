# PlaygroundHiit


Spent second semester of my junior year building a Swift Application for Michylle Padillaâ€™s Senior Project. The application is designed as a High-Intensity Interval Training application for parents. The idea behind the app is that all exercises are something a parent could do while with their kids at the playground. The application uses common iOS interface components and 3rd party frameworks for graphing and timing to deliver an interesting take on HIIT.


The charts, concept, icons, and images in this project were assembled by me, but do not belong to me. Appropriate Attributions are given in the other files. 

This project conforms to the latest Swift Syntax as of 1/27/16. This project is not kept up to date and may not function after significant changes to the Swift Language.
